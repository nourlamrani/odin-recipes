     regions of Algeria. It is eaten as a main course every day of Ramadan.

    It is a light soup that is made of tomatoes and Frik (a certain kind of wheat that is green in 
    color and rich in fibers), coriander, onions, celery, meat, and chickpeas.
    
    Every day of Ramadan, Algerians cook a brand new batch of Chorba Frik to break their fast with.
